### Credibility of Information & Data
The information displayed before you is based on the COVID-19 Statistical data obtained from <strong>John's Hopkins Medical School</strong> & <strong>Ministry of Health & Childcare</strong> Updates in Zimbabwe that are published every evening on their respective platforms. 


### Codes for Embedding
This is the layout that I use for embedding into Websites (Including Wordpress Hosted sites) and it really works out for me. Hopefully it will work out for you too.
<br>
I made use of the <code>embed</code> tag. So make sure to add the <code>tag</code> before the <code>src</code> attribute
<br>


<b>Embed our dashboard into your webpage:</b>
